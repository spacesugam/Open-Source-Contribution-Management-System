# Open-Source-Contribution-Management-System
Description:
As the creator and developer of the Open-Source Contribution Management System, I have designed and implemented a robust database management project using Java and MySQL. This system serves as a comprehensive solution for tracking and managing open-source projects, including project leadership, contributions, performance evaluation, and issue tracking.

Key Features:

Project Leadership: The system allows for the manual entry of project leaders, enabling efficient tracking of project ownership and accountability.

Contribution Management: By recording and tracking individual contributions, the system provides a transparent overview of each contributor's involvement, fostering a collaborative environment.

Performance Evaluation: The system enables the assessment and evaluation of contributors' performance, ensuring recognition and accountability for their efforts.

Issue Tracking: With the capability to log both open and closed issues, the system offers a centralized platform for managing and resolving project-related challenges.

By creating the Open-Source Contribution Management System, I have demonstrated my proficiency in Java and MySQL, as well as my ability to design and develop a scalable and user-friendly database management system. This project showcases my strong attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and commitment to streamlining open-source project management processes.

Overall, this project exemplifies my dedication to leveraging technology to improve efficiency, foster collaboration, and support the open-source community.
